# Development

## Toolchain

The Rust version and targets come from [`rust-toolchain.toml`](../rust-toolchain.toml)
and nowhere else, so local and CI use exactly the same thing. rustup installs it
on the first `cargo` invocation.

An exact version is pinned rather than `stable`: with `stable`, a release landing
between a local build and a CI build would be enough for them to stop matching.

> If `rustc --version` says `(Homebrew)` or anything other than what the file
> says, a second Rust installation is shadowing rustup on your `PATH` and the
> file is being ignored. Put `$HOME/.cargo/bin` first, or remove the other one.

## The short way

The [`Makefile`](../Makefile) wraps everything below, and knows the one bit of
ordering that reading the commands does not give you — the wasm is a build input
to the web project, so it has to be compiled before anything under `web/`.

```sh
make install   # toolchain, wasm-pack, test corpus, npm dependencies
make build     # wasm, release CLI, static site in web/dist
make test      # fmt, clippy, cargo test, wasm smoke test, oxlint
make up        # dev server
```

Nothing there is a new source of truth: every recipe is the command CI runs, and
the rest of this page explains what each one is for. Reach for the commands
directly when you want a single step.

## Build and test

```sh
cargo test                 # debug: overflow checks on
cargo test --release       # what ships
cargo build --release      # CLI at target/release/vektro
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets
```

## The web build

The page is a Vite + Preact project rooted at [`web/`](../web). The wasm is a
**build input** to it, so it goes first:

```sh
wasm-pack build --release --target web \
  --out-dir web/pkg --out-name vektro \
  -- --no-default-features --features wasm,illustration

cd web
npm install
npm run dev            # servidor de desarrollo
npm run build          # sitio estático en web/dist
npm run preview        # sirve lo construido
npm run lint           # oxlint
```

The wasm must be served over HTTP — opening the HTML from the filesystem will not
work, because the page loads a module worker. The dev server takes care of that;
there is no longer any reason to reach for `python3 -m http.server`.

`npm run build` runs `npm run logo` first, which copies `vektro.svg` from the
repository root into `web/static/`. That directory is Vite's `publicDir`: what is
in it is served as-is and referenced by URL. Everything else is imported, and
therefore hashed and fingerprinted by the bundler — including `web/pkg/`, which
is why the wasm package is **not** in `static/`.

`base` is `"./"` in [`web/vite.config.js`](../web/vite.config.js). Pages serves
the site from `/vektro/`, not from a domain root, and the default `/` would
produce a build that works locally and 404s every asset in production.

### The layout

| Folder | What is in it |
| --- | --- |
| `web/static` | copied verbatim, served by URL, never imported (the logo) |
| `web/assets` | imported and hashed (the stylesheet) |
| `web/components` | presentational only; they import nothing but each other |
| `web/services` | the worker, the converter store, formatting helpers |
| `web/views` | the shell and the two panels; may use components and services |
| `web/pkg` | wasm-pack output: generated, ignored, imported |

`web/services/converter.js` is the only module that talks to the worker. The
views read its signals and call `load`, `convert` and `reset`; none of them knows
there are messages, request ids or a debounce timer.

`--no-default-features` is deliberate: the browser decodes the image, so the Rust
image codecs are half a megabyte of dead weight in the bundle.

`illustration` is in, so the page ships **one** bundle with both modes. Measured, it
costs 152 KB → 209 KB raw but only 52 KB → 68 KB brotli, and the rule of thumb
this was weighed against was written in raw bytes. Seventeen kilobytes over the
wire does not pay for two `pkg/` directories, a loader that picks between them,
two wasm builds in CI and two `.d.ts` files to keep an eye on. Revisit if the
curve fitters change the shape of that.

### The committed `.d.ts`

`web/pkg/` is generated and ignored **except** `web/pkg/vektro.d.ts`, which is
committed. CI rebuilds the wasm and then runs `git diff --exit-code` against it,
so the API JavaScript sees cannot change without the change appearing in a diff.

After any intentional change to it, rebuild, **read the diff** and commit the
file. Expect it to fire on a wasm-bindgen bump too: that rewrites the whole
`InitOutput` block, which lists internal exports. Noise, but of the honest kind —
the published surface really did change.

Two traps, both already paid for:

- `.gitignore` excludes `/web/pkg/*` and not `/web/pkg/`. Git does not descend
  into an excluded *directory*, so with the second form the `!` exception below
  it would never even be read.
- wasm-pack writes its own `web/pkg/.gitignore` containing `*`, and the deeper
  file wins. The first `git add` therefore needed `-f`. Once tracked, ignore
  rules no longer apply to it.

### Exercising the wasm from JavaScript

```sh
node scripts/web-smoke.mjs
```

Loads `web/pkg/vektro.js`, hands `init()` the `.wasm` bytes directly — so it
needs no server and no browser — and calls `convertRgba` / `convertIllustration` on a
synthetic buffer built in the script, the way `tests/golden.rs` does. The wasm
has no image codecs in it (the browser decodes), so a PNG would be no use here.

It checks the three things the Rust tests structurally cannot:

1. the wasm boots and returns an SVG;
2. **every field `web/services/worker.js` copies** is still there — that object
   is the real coupling between page and wasm, and a renamed getter shows up
   there as `undefined` rather than as an error;
3. **the option keys are read.** They come out of a `Reflect::get` by string, so
   a typo does not fail, it quietly takes the default. The committed `.d.ts`
   freezes the *declared* shape of the API; this is what says it is also wired.

Verified by breaking it: renaming the `"polygon"` arm in `read_fit` makes exactly
the `fitTolerance` check fail, on both entry points, with everything else green.
It runs in CI, right after the wasm build.

## Tests

| Suite | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| `tests/checker.rs`, `grid.rs`, `trace.rs`, `background.rs`, `color.rs`, `palette.rs`, `cluster.rs`, `speckle.rs`, `boundary.rs` | Unit tests per module. |
| `tests/fit.rs` | The fitting axis, read back out of the emitted `d` attributes rather than from internals — segments and their control points, so curves can be compared as curves. Holds the seam check (every interior segment *and every cubic* is drawn by exactly two faces, identically), the tolerance ceiling for both fitters, and that a digitised circle closes without a kink. |
| `tests/golden.rs` | Snapshots of the pixel art path over a synthetic ASCII sprite. Input lives in the file, so it runs anywhere. |
| `tests/resample.rs` | The working scale: that one number decides the working canvas whatever the file size, that upscaling is capped, that a flat colour survives the filter unchanged, that a cut-out's edge does not darken (premultiplied alpha), and that the document is still announced at the source's size. |
| `tests/wobble.rs` | Contour filing: that it costs fewer numbers, that a right angle stays exactly where it was, and that no vertex moves further than the cap — without which this would be a smoothing. |
| `tests/softness.rs` | The softness measure: that a hard edge measures zero, that a transition measures its width, and that **the same pair of colours** can come out hard in one place and soft in another — which is what makes it a property of the boundary rather than of the colours. |
| `tests/illustration.rs` | Snapshots of the illustration path over a synthetic drawing — a gradient, two flat blocks, a one-pixel line and a few loose dots, one motif per behaviour that was decided by looking at results. |
| `tests/corpus.rs` | Snapshots over the real images in `examples/`. |

### Snapshots

`tests/golden/` holds the committed output of each case. They exist so a refactor
can prove it did not change behaviour — they catch things no unit test sees, like
a lost `simplify` filling every path with collinear vertices without changing the
drawing.

After an intentional change:

```sh
UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 cargo test
```

and **read the diff** before committing. Each snapshot carries the conversion
metadata in a comment header, so the diff says *what* changed — the grid, the
path count — and not merely that something did. They are still valid SVGs; open
one in a browser.

On a mismatch the actual output is dumped alongside as `*.actual` for a real
`diff`.

### The corpus

`examples/` is not versioned — the three PNGs weigh 9 MB — so they hang off a
release of their own, `corpus-v1`, and come down with:

```sh
scripts/corpus.sh
```

That release is not a version of the program: nothing about it moves when a
`v0.x` ships, it is not marked as latest, and the script pins it by tag rather
than following the newest one. The day the corpus changes it takes a new tag, the
tag changed in the script, and the snapshots regenerated in the same commit:

```sh
scripts/corpus-release.sh corpus-v2
```

It packs the images `scripts/corpus.sha256` names, straight out of `examples/`,
and refuses to publish when they do not match those checksums. There is no
archive to hand it on purpose: that list is what the fetch script verifies and
what the tests read, so the only thing publishable is what the repository already
calls the corpus. It wants a token with `Contents: write`.

The script checks the unpacked PNGs against `scripts/corpus.sha256` and fetches
again when they do not match; without them `tests/corpus.rs` skips with a notice.
Their *output* snapshots are committed, so the regression signal is in git even
though the inputs are not, and each header carries the input's FNV hash to tell a
changed image apart from a code regression.

`REQUIRE_CORPUS=1` turns a missing corpus into a failure instead of a silent
pass. CI sets it, having fetched the corpus a step earlier.

## CI

**`build.yml`** runs on every push to `main`: format, clippy, the corpus fetch,
tests in debug and release, the wasm build, and then the two checks over what
that build produced — the `.d.ts` diff and `scripts/web-smoke.mjs`. It publishes
nothing — it just leaves the built `web/` as an artifact.

Tests run in debug *as well as* release because release turns overflow checks
off — that is exactly how a `u8` underflow in `checker.rs` survived unnoticed.

**`release.yml`** is manual: pick `patch`, `minor` or `major` from the
`workflow_dispatch` menu. It bumps the version in `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`,
commits as `release: vX.Y.Z`, tags, then reuses `build.yml` on that commit and
fans out into:

- **`pages`** — deploys the site. Pages must be enabled under **Settings → Pages
  → Source: GitHub Actions**.
- **`binaries`** — the CLI for five targets (macOS arm64/x86_64, Linux
  arm64/x86_64, Windows x86_64).
- **`publish`** — creates the GitHub release with all of it attached, the web
  package included.

**The site only updates on release**, not on every push to `main`. That is
deliberate: what is published then always corresponds to a tagged version.

Two details worth knowing before editing these:

- `build.yml` skips its own run when the commit message starts with `release:`,
  otherwise every release would trigger a duplicate build.
- The reusable call passes an explicit `ref`. A called workflow checks out the
  default branch, so without it the release would build the commit *before* the
  version bump.

## Session notes

`SESSIONS/` holds the design record: what was decided, why, and what it corrected
about the previous plan. One file per working session, named

```
YYYY-MM-DD-HHhMM.slug.md
```

The time is when the document was written, not when it was last edited, so a
document that keeps getting updated keeps its name. Sorting by filename therefore
sorts chronologically, which matters because several can land on one day, and the
newest one is the live list — each says at the top which of its predecessors it
supersedes.

They are **history, not documentation**: an older file records what was true when
it was written and is deliberately not corrected afterwards. Anything meant to stay
true belongs in `docs/`.

## Language

Source comments, test names and program output are in Spanish. Documentation —
this file, the README, `docs/` and `SESSIONS/` — is in English.
